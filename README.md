# Pickpod

A Streamlit web service to pick up podcasts based on your own unpopular views.

Welcome to our commercial deployment: [Pickpod](https://pickpod.shixiangcap.com/welcome), implementation with `Java` and microservice architecture.

The personal open-source prototype needs to refactor some `Python` code, which is coming soon.
